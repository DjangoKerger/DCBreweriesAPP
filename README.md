# DCBreweriesAPP
Django, Steve, and Hannahs brewery app


Hello!! 

We are excited to bring you our Brewery App. Our app was developed to assist you to find the nearest Breweries in your location.

Our goal was to make a simple and intuitive mobile app, that translated into a smooth user experience. 

As you open the app it will ask you for your location, and then dynamically show your location on the map; along with the nearest breweries.

Our team developed the front end with bootstrap, css, and html styling. 

For the api request we use async functions along with callback functions in order to programmatically generate brewery listings and user location.

We added google maps to help generate an easy interaction between user and application, we rendered the map through index.html while also adding scripts. We created seperate customized markers to show user and brewery locations.

I hope you enjoy! :)

Note: Due to the api restricitions, starting from June 2020 we will be using hard coded data. In order to render the list.
